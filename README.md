Expenses tracking project in PyQt4

![QuickExpenses-1.0](http://i.imgur.com/6MqUS88.png)

*QuickExpenses* is a GUI program that allows you to quickly track your expenses by providing the interface to

 * add expenses that happened on a particular date while tagging them with a user-defined set of "tags",
 * and to display them in a table or a tree view, optionally filtering by the existing tags.

It stores the data in a SQLite3 database and updates its interface on the fly.

More importantly, it allowed me to practice developing a PyQt4 application (which I did for the first time!),
and by that reason the program itself is not super feature-rich, but rather provides the very basic "raison d'Ãªtre"
functionality and may not be free of bugs.  The TODO list currently consists of more than ten points I believe yet
it's unlikely to get shorter anywhere soon.
