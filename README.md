QuickExpenses

Expenses tracking project in PyQt4

![QuickExpenses-1.0](http://i.imgur.com/6MqUS88.png)

*QuickExpenses* is a GUI program that allows **you** to quickly track your
expenses by providing the interface for

 * adding expenses that occured on a particular date while tagging those
   expenses with a user-defined set of "tags",
 * displaying them in a table- or a tree-view, optionally filtering by existing
   tags.

It stores the data in a SQLite3 database; GUI is updated on the fly.

More importantly, writing QuickExpenses allowed **me** to practice developing a
PyQt4 application (which I did for the first time in my life), and by that
reason the program itself is not super feature-rich, but rather provides very
basic, "raison d'Ãªtre" functionality and may not be free of bugs.  The TODO list
currently consists of more than ten points, I believe, yet it's unlikely to get
shorter anytime soon.
